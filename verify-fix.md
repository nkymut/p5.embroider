# Color Export Fix Verification

## Problem Identified
The p5.embroider library was adding **both** trim commands and color change commands when switching colors, causing issues with DST export.

## Root Cause
In `src/p5.embroider.js` lines 525-526, the `stroke()` function was automatically calling `trimThread()` every time the color changed:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (PROBLEMATIC):
if (_strokeThreadIndex !== threadIndex && _stitchData.threads[_strokeThreadIndex] !== undefined) {
  trimThread(); // ❌ This added trim commands for every color change
}
```

This caused **double commands**:
1. `trimThread()` added a trim command when switching colors
2. `exportDST()` added a color change command when processing threads

## Fix Applied
**Removed automatic trim calls** from the `stroke()` function:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED):
// Note: Color changes are handled automatically during export
// Manual trimThread() calls can still be made if needed
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:
```
Thread 0 (red): [stitches] → TRIM COMMAND
Thread 1 (green): [stitches] → TRIM COMMAND  
Thread 2 (blue): [stitches] → TRIM COMMAND
PLUS color change commands during export = DUPLICATED COMMANDS
```

### After Fix:
```
Thread 0 (red): [stitches]
Thread 1 (green): [stitches] 
Thread 2 (blue): [stitches]
ONLY color change commands during export = CLEAN DST FILE
```

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Test the color example**:
   ```bash
   # Open examples/color/index.html in browser
   # Click "Export DST" 
   # DST file should now have proper color changes without redundant trim commands
   ```

2. **Check DST file structure**:
   - Should have 6 color changes (for ROYGBIV colors)
   - Should NOT have trim commands between each color
   - Each color change should be at the proper stitch position

3. **Manual verification**:
   - Users can still call `trimThread()` manually when needed
   - Automatic color changes work seamlessly
   - No performance impact from redundant commands

## DST Export Flow (Fixed)

1. **Recording Phase**:
   - `stroke(red)` → creates red thread
   - `ellipse()` → adds stitches to red thread
   - `stroke(green)` → creates green thread (NO automatic trim)
   - `ellipse()` → adds stitches to green thread
   - etc.

2. **Export Phase**:
   - Process thread 0 (red) → add stitches
   - Switch to thread 1 (green) → add COLOR_CHANGE command
   - Process thread 1 (green) → add stitches  
   - Switch to thread 2 (blue) → add COLOR_CHANGE command
   - etc.

## Result
The DST file will now export correctly with proper color changes and no redundant trim commands, making it compatible with embroidery machines.
